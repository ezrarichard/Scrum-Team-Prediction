# Scrum Team Story Points & Completion Prediction App

## Getting Started
This application leverages machine learning to predict the number of story points a Scrum team can complete in a future sprint, based on historical data. By inputting details about the team size, leaves, working days, and availability, users can get an estimate of the story points and the actual completion rate to better plan their sprint activities.
